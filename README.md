## Usage

**Purpose** and **Aim** of this bot is as following:

- **Mainly**, it is use to sync chat or logs in discord and minecraft

- _Possibly_, for it to be use for managing server from outside minecraft, thus admin and server moderator can
  write command from discord channel and affect server. It'll be like remote console...

> Right now, aim and purpose is still not clear, maybe there will be more feature and purpose for this bot...

Created and used for both minecraft and discord server hosted by members of **Aelicia's Den**
